# little-big-mouse
My goal for this repository is to create a space for experts, knowledgeable users, developers, basically anyone who understands Little Big Mouse, to offer their support for to new users or existing users who have questions.
I have recently downloaded the software. My main objective was to change cursor size based on monitor. When i opened the program I realized there was very little instructional information and I could not find anything online to help me.  I believe there are people out there who also download the software and like me, can't figure out how to use it.
I would like anyone who uses Little Big Mouse and is kind enough to share any information, tutorials, lessons learned, etc to be share their knowledge here for the greater good of the program and its users.
I would also like new users of Little Big Mouse who have questions to place their inquiries here so hopefully someone knowledgable will be able to assist. 
Thank you in advance to all who are willing to share knowledge.

NOTE: I still don't know how to change the cursor size so.... help please?
